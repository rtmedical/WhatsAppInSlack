- **Dockerfile**: Contains the configuration to create a Docker image for the application.
- **.env.example**: An example environment file that contains key-value pairs for necessary environment variables. Before starting the application, you'll need to copy this file and name it as `.env`.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose configuration file to run the entire application stack.
- **app**: This directory contains the main application logic.
  - **app.js**: The main entry point for our application.
  - **db.js**: Responsible for database operations.
  - **package.json**: Contains metadata about the application and its dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rtmedical/WhatsAppInSlack.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd WhatsAppInSlack
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file and name the copy as `.env`. Modify the necessary environment variables according to your setup.

4. Using Docker Compose, build and run the application:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application should now be up and running!

## Configuration

Before starting the application, ensure you have set up the environment variables in the `.env` file. Refer to `.env.example` for required variables.

Inside `WhatsAppInSlack/app/db.js`, you will find the following MongoDB connection URI:

```javascript
const uri = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster-url/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority";
```

We recommend using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a hassle-free MongoDB hosting experience. They offer a free tier that is sufficient for most starter projects.
